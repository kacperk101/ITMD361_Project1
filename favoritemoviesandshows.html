	 <h1>Breaking Bad</h1>
	
	<section id="breakingbad">
	<p> Breaking Bad has been rated as the best TV show of all time and I firmly believe it deserves that title. Every single character in the show is played so well by their actors. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, 
	in my opinion, pulled off some of the best acting I have ever seen. The plot was so well designed and the pacing of the show was perfect. There's a reason the show is so popular, even today.</p>
