	 <h1>Breaking Bad</h1>
	
	<section id="breakingbad">
	<p> Breaking Bad has been rated as the best TV show of all time and I firmly believe it deserves that title. Every single character in the show is played so well by their actors. I don't think there's one charater in the show that was acted out poorly. 
	Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, in my opinion, pulled off some of the best acting I have ever seen. The plot was so well designed and the pacing of the show was perfect. There's a reason the show is so popular, even today.</p>

	<h1>The Last of Us</h1>
	
	<section id="tlou">
	<p>The people behind both the game and show for The Last of Us have to be labeled as geniuses. The video game version of The Last of Us is iconic and by far one of the best video games of all time.
	The same can be said for the TV show adaptation for The Last of Us. The directors for the show chose the perfect actors to play Joel and Ellie. Pedro Pascal not only looks similar to Joel but replicates him very well.
	Bella Ramsey plays Ellie well for the most part, however there are some moments where she doesn't replicate Ellie as well as she could but maybe this is me nitpicking. The cinematography in The Last of Us is breathtaking. It's not only beautiful but
	the angles play a part in the story telling. Overall, I hope to see more of this show and what it has to offer because I truly think it can be one of the best shows to come out within the last ten years.
