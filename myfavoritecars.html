  <h1>My Favorite Cars</h1>

  <section id="firstcar">
    <h2>Ford Mustang GT500</h2>
    <p>This car is listed first for a reason. It's my dream car and I hope to own and drive my own GT500 one day. Here's what it sounds like!</p>

  <section id="secondcar">
    <h2>McLaren P1</h2>
    <p>This car is second for no particular reason. I love McLarens and the way their cars look.</p>

  <section id="thirdcar">
    <h2>Bugatti Chiron Super Sport</h2>
    <p>This car and the Bugatti brand is by far the most iconic in the world of supercars. This car not only looks amazing but sounds amazing. This is definitely the best looking Bugatti ever made. I recently saw this car in person. Here's my own picture below!</p>

  <section id="fourthcar">
    <h2>Ferrari SF90</h2>
    <p>This car looks extremely elegant. You could put any single color on this car and it would look fantastic no matter what.</p>
